# CreditRiskScoringStratio

## Business Case

> An important bank needs to ﬁlter good and bad credit requests as the bank receives them from potential clients (credit requesters). They need this to be automatic. The bank provides three ﬁles: 1) A sample of the bank’s historic credit request data, that they want to be automatically preprocessed from now on. 2) An example of one day’s requests to be used as input for the AI Model in the scoring workﬂow, and get a predicted default probability. 3) Credit bureau data (external data about clients) to enhance the scoring process with evidences of legal cases or police reports, applying this evidences of fraud in the workﬂow. Based on the data in this three ﬁles, the bank’s business analysts expect to receive a risk level scoring (red, yellow, or green) to be stored in a database (or parquet ﬁle) and presented in a Dashboard.
